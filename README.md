# Bank Loan Analysis Dashboard

## **Project Objective**
This dashboard provides an interactive view of bank loan data, enabling stakeholders to gain insights into key performance indicators (KPIs), trends, and make data-driven decisions to optimize lending operations.

## **Dashboard 1: Summary**
### **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):**
1. **Total Loan Applications**: Tracks the number of loan applications, including Month-to-Date (MTD) and Month-over-Month (MoM) trends.
2. **Total Funded Amount**: Displays the total funds disbursed as loans, with MTD and MoM calculations.
3. **Total Amount Received**: Shows the total amount received from borrowers, including MTD and MoM data.
4. **Average Interest Rate**: Calculates the average interest rate, including MTD and MoM trends.
5. **Average Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI)**: Evaluates the average DTI of borrowers, including MTD and MoM calculations.

### **Good Loan vs Bad Loan KPIs:**
- **Good Loan Application Percentage**
- **Bad Loan Application Percentage**
- **Good Loan Funded Amount**
- **Bad Loan Funded Amount**
- **Good Loan Total Received Amount**
- **Bad Loan Total Received Amount**

### **Loan Status Grid View**:
A grid view report categorizing loans by 'Loan Status' with metrics like Total Loan Applications, Total Funded Amount, Total Amount Received, MTD Funded Amount, Average Interest Rate, and Average DTI.

## **Dashboard 2: Overview**
### **Charts**:
1. **Monthly Trends by Issue Date** (Line Chart)
2. **Regional Analysis by State** (Filled Map)
3. **Loan Term Analysis** (Donut Chart)
4. **Employee Length Analysis** (Bar Chart)
5. **Loan Purpose Breakdown** (Bar Chart)
6. **Home Ownership Analysis** (Tree Map)

### **Metrics**:
- **Total Loan Applications**

## **Dashboard 3: Details**
### **Grid View**:
Provides a detailed view of individual loan data, including:
- Loan ID, Purpose, Home Ownership, Grade, Sub-Grade, Issue Date, Funded Amount, Interest Rate, Installment Amount, Amount Collected.

## **Benefits**:
- **Improved Decision-Making**: Data-driven decisions for loan pricing, risk assessment, and portfolio management.
- **Enhanced Risk Management**: Identifying and mitigating potential risks.
- **Improved Customer Service**: Understanding customer needs and improving service quality.
- **Operational Efficiency**: Streamlining loan processing and management workflows.

## **Next Steps**:
- Implement the dashboard using a BI tool (e.g., Power BI, Tableau).
- Integrate data sources and create data connections.
- Develop and implement interactive features (filters, slicers, drill-down capabilities).
- Conduct user testing and gather feedback.
